            Since I am somewhat of an obsessive HumbleBundle user, I have accrued a lot of games I do not actually want
            to play. If you are interested in any of these games, please let me know and I will (consider to) give it to
            you. There is no guarantee that games listed here are actually still available, however, I try my best to
            keep this list updated.
        </p>

        <p id="condition">
            The only condition I have for giving these games away is that I want you to play them and not hoard them
            like I did.
